# Todo Application MD   
Todo Application MD is a Simple Todo Application. React.js was used to build this project.This Todo Application uses react redux concepts. It showcases the Traditional method of using redux -- before Redux Toolkit came into Picture. TodoApp is a Task Tracker app that only does CRUD operations, unlike many other apps. 

This project aimed to understand and use React.js and traditional Redux concepts together. Plain CSS is used for styling. Hence, it does not feature any advanced tasks Tracking features. Additionally, I tried to implement various techniques that we may use in a production application. This project is not complete (as no web app could ever be sufficiently called complete) as we could always enhance the existing feature, fix bugs and add new features. I plan to revisit this project when I want to try something new.

This project is hosted on [Github Pages](https://github.com/D-Ankita/todoApp-redux-MD).
